Reproducing Sprout
==================

To run the experiment:

    $ git submodule init

This will initialize the alfalfa and multisend repositories.
Instructions on how to compile these dependencies are available
at http://alfalfa.mit.edu/.

    $ sudo ./run.sh

This should take ~19 hours. Remember to provide at least 4GB of
memory in order to avoid failure.
